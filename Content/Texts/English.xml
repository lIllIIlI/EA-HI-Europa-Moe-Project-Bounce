  <faction.EAHI.description>The precursor of Europa East Asia Heavy Industries, the most renowned conglomerate on Europa, was originally a research outpost affiliated with Earth's East Asia Heavy Industries. As Europa gradually lost contact with Earth, the former research station transformed into the largest mining machinery supplier on Europa, leveraging its legacy industrial mother machines. After the Tormsdale nuclear disaster, EAHI acquired the majority of uranium mines from the Europa Union at a remarkably low price, becoming the largest mining trust across all of Europa. Negative rumors about EAHI have always circulated in secret, but publicly, they are hailed as the cornerstone of the Union's prosperity. </faction.EAHI.description>
  <faction.EAHI.shortdescription>East Asia Heavy Industries is a massive corporation specializing in mining and engineering machinery manufacturing. It enjoys a high reputation across Europa and has extensive cooperation with the Europa Union. </faction.EAHI.shortdescription>
